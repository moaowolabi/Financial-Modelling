# Financial-Modelling
Examples of the computational methods I've used to create different financial modules and simulations
 In one of the files created i used VBA and solver to cumpute Global Minimum Variance Portfolio, Optimal Risky Portfolio and Optimal Complete Portfolio for Visa, Berkshire Hathaway and Nvidia stocks in one Portfolio (for a 6 months period) to fully optimise it with the right weighting for each stock. In this file i computed the follow for each stock: Returns, Volatility, CAGR, Annualized Volatility (VBA Implementation for CAGR & Annualized Volatility), Covariance Matrix, GMVP, (using a T-Bill as the Risk-Free Rate) ORP, OCP and Portfolio Allocation.
 In another file, I calculated the Risk and Return of Palantir Technologies stock and the S&P 500's daily closing prices for a 9 Month Period. I computed the following: Annualised Return and Annualised Volatility, 1-day 95% Value-at-Risk (VaR) and estimated the CAPM beta of the stock using the S&P 500.
