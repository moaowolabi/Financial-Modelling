# Financial-Modelling
Examples of the computational methods I've used to create different financial modules and simulations.
 In one of the files created, I used VBA and Solver to compute a Global Minimum Variance Portfolio, an Optimal Risky Portfolio, and an Optimal Complete Portfolio for Visa, Berkshire Hathaway, and Nvidia stocks in a single portfolio (for a 6-month period) to fully optimise it with the right weighting for each stock. In this file, I computed the following for each stock: Returns, Volatility, CAGR, Annualised Volatility (VBA Implementation for CAGR & Annualised Volatility), Covariance Matrix, GMVP, ORP (using a T-Bill as the Risk-Free Rate), OCP and Portfolio Allocation.
 In another file, I calculated the Risk and Return of Palantir Technologies stock and the S&P 500's daily closing prices for a 9 Month Period. I computed the following: Annualised Return and Annualised Volatility, 1-day 95% Value-at-Risk (VaR) and estimated the CAPM beta of the stock using the S&P 500.
 In the next file, I calculated the Moving Average Convergence Divergence Indicator in Excel. Based on my analyses, I realised during this period, PLTR showed strong upward momentum between October 2024 and February 2025, as the MACD line stayed above the signal line and the histogram expanded positively. The crossover of the MACD below the signal line in March 2025 indicated weakening momentum and a potential trend reversal. The declining histogram confirmed bearish divergence, suggesting that buying pressure was fading. During this period, I would consider taking profits or reducing long positions as bearish momentum builds.
Following that, I calculated the Relative Strength Index Indicator in Excel. The RSI remained above 70 for much of the late 2024 to early 2025 period, confirming strong bullish momentum and an overbought market condition. The subsequent fall below 50 indicated a shift toward neutral or bearish momentum. The indicator suggests that buying enthusiasm peaked earlier and that a pullback or correction is likely. I would avoid new long entries during overbought periods and look for potential short or sell signals as RSI declines.
I then calculated the Bollinger Bands Indicator in Excel. From December 2024 through February 2025, PLTRâ€™s price frequently touched or exceeded the upper Bollinger Band, indicating strong bullish momentum but also overextension. As volatility began to narrow in March 2025 and prices moved closer to the middle and lower bands, market consolidation followed. The squeeze pattern hints at a potential volatility breakout. Moving forward, I would be cautious of a possible price correction and monitor for breakout confirmation before entering new positions.
