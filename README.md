# Financial-Modelling
Examples of the computational methods I've used to create different financial modules and simulations.
 In one of the files created i used VBA and solver to cumpute Global Minimum Variance Portfolio, Optimal Risky Portfolio and Optimal Complete Portfolio for Visa, Berkshire Hathaway and Nvidia stocks in one Portfolio (for a 6 months period) to fully optimise it with the right weighting for each stock. In this file i computed the follow for each stock: Returns, Volatility, CAGR, Annualized Volatility (VBA Implementation for CAGR & Annualized Volatility), Covariance Matrix, GMVP, (using a T-Bill as the Risk-Free Rate) ORP, OCP and Portfolio Allocation.
 In another file, I calculated the Risk and Return of Palantir Technologies stock and the S&P 500's daily closing prices for a 9 Month Period. I computed the following: Annualised Return and Annualised Volatility, 1-day 95% Value-at-Risk (VaR) and estimated the CAPM beta of the stock using the S&P 500.
 In the next file, I calculated the Moving Average Convergence Divergence Indicator in Excel. Based on my analyses i realised during this period, PLTR showed strong upward momentum between October 2024 and February 2025, as the MACD line stayed above the signal line and the histogram expanded positively. The crossover of the MACD below the signal line in March 2025 indicated weakening momentum and a potential trend reversal. The declining histogram confirmed bearish divergence, suggesting that buying pressure was fading. During this period I would consider taking profits or reducing long positions as bearish momentum builds.
